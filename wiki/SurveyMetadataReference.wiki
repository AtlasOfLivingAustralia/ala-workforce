== Question set structure ==

A survey is defined as metadata in XML.  This metadata consists of a set of question definitions and other survey related data. An overview of the syntax of a question set is shown below. More detailed descriptions of metadata elements come after that. Optional elements are surrounds by square brackets.

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<questionSet>
  <title>...</title>
  <shortName>...</shortName>
  [<requiredRole>...</requiredRole>]
  <pageSequence>
    ...
  </pageSequence>
  [<knownQuestions>
    ...
  </knownQuestions>]
  [<accounts>
      ...
  </accounts>]
  <question>
    ...
  </question>
  ...
</questionSet>
}}}

==== Title, Short Name ====

The title and shortName text elements define the title and short title of the survey.  For example,

{{{
<title>Survey of Australian Taxonomic Workforce - Personal Survey</title>
<shortName>Personal Survey</shortName>
}}}

==== Required Role ====

The required role element defines the ALA authorisation that a user requires to carry out the survey.  For example the ABRS Institutional survey requires a user to have ROLE_ABRS_INSTITUTION. A when a user logs into the ABRS Survey web application if they have this authorisation then the ABRS Institutional survey is displayed, otherwise the ABRS Personal survey is displayed.

{{{
<requiredRole>ROLE_ABRS_INSTITUTION</requiredRole>
}}}

==== Page Sequence ====

The pageSequence element defines the pagination of a survey.  Each page sub-element defines which questions appear on that page.

{{{
<pageSequence>
  <page>1-2</page>
  <page>3-3</page>
  <page>4-5</page>
  <page>6-6</page>
    ...
</pageSequence>
}}}
